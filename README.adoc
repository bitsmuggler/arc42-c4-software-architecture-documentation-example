= Software Architecture Documentation Example with arc42 and C4 Model

This example shows how to use arc42 in combination with the C4 model with the Documentation as Code technique.

It shows how to use the techniques described in https://www.workingsoftware.dev/software-architecture-documentation-the-ultimate-guide/[The ultimate Guide to Software Architecture Documentation].

Technologies involved:

* https://arc42.org/[arc42] to get the structure for the software architecture documentation
* https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software.
* https://structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL] to describe the https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] of the software system
* https://github.com/structurizr/cli[Structurizr CLI] a command line utility for Structurizr to export the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL
* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] as format to write the software architecture documentation
* https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] to generate the representations of the software architecture documentation written in asciidoc. docToolchain makes use of  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor].
* https://kroki.io[kroki] to generate diagrams

== Prerequisites

* Download the https://github.com/structurizr/cli/releases[structurizr-cli], unzip and move it into `./bin/structurizr-cli`
  
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
curl --show-error --location https://github.com/structurizr/cli/releases/download/v{selected-version}/structurizr-cli-{selected-version}.zip  -o tmp.zip && unzip -d bin/structurizr-cli/. tmp.zip && rm tmp.zip
----

* Generate the diagrams from the structurizr workspace model

[source, bash]
----
./bin/structurizr-cli/structurizr.sh export -w bank.dsl -format plantuml/structurizr -output documentation/diagrams
----

== Generate the software architecture documentation representations

NOTE: these examples use the public https://kroki.io[kroki.io] instance to generate the diagrams.
For your own documentation, replace the references to kroki.io with your own kroki instance.

* Generate the documentation as single HTML file

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateHTML
----

Generate the documentation as PDF representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generatePDF
----

* Generate the documentation as Microsite

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateSite
----
