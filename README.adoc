= Software Architecture Documentation Starter with arc42 and C4 Model

image::banner.png[]

This example shows how to use https://arc42.org/[arc42] in combination with the https://c4model.com/[C4 model] with the Documentation as Code technique.

It shows how to use the techniques described in https://www.workingsoftware.dev/software-architecture-documentation-the-ultimate-guide/[The Ultimate Guide to Software Architecture Documentation].

If you're looking for a step-by-step video on how to use this starter project, you can find it on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLcUISoEn2s

Check out the deployed https://bitsmuggler.github.io/arc42-c4-software-architecture-documentation-example/[example HTML build] provided on GitHub Pages.

Go through the following steps:

. <<Prerequisites>>
. <<Build the software architecture documentation>>
.. <<Generate PlantUML Diagrams from the C4 (Structurizr) Model>>
.. <<Generate the software architecture documentation representations>>


== Technologies

* https://arc42.org/[arc42] to get the structure for the software architecture documentation
* https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software.
* https://structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL] to describe the https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] of the software system
* https://github.com/structurizr/cli[Structurizr CLI] a command line utility for Structurizr to export the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL
* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] as format to write the software architecture documentation
* https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] to generate the representations of the software architecture documentation written in AsciiDoc.
* https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] to automate the generation of the software architecture documentation.
* https://kroki.io[Kroki] to generate diagrams
* https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools] to generate and manage Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* https://www.workingsoftware.dev/technical-debt-records/[Technical Debt Records] to record technical debts (TDRs)

== Prerequisites

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you don't plan to use the https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools], you can skip this step. Please make sure that Chapter 09 Architecture Decisions does not contain any references to the ADRs.
====

=== Install adr-tools and adjust the ADR template

The ADR template is based on Markdown and the ADR chapters must be adapted to the chapter levels of the arc42 template.

. Install https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools]
. Get the path of the adr template of the adr-tools via `adr config`
. Replace the content of the `template.md` file with the content of the link:./adr-template.md[adr-template.md] file of this repository.

==== Migrate the generated markdown based decisions with docToolchain

If you have already generated ADRs with the adr-tools, you can migrate them to the AsciiDoc format with the following steps.

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw exportMarkdown && cp ./build/adrs/*.adoc ./documentation/adrs/
----

== Build the software architecture documentation

=== Generate PlantUML Diagrams from the C4 (Structurizr) Model

https://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/[docToolchain] uses the Structurizr CLI to generate the PlantUML diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL.

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw exportStructurizr
----

=== Generate the software architecture documentation representations

NOTE: these examples use the public https://kroki.io[kroki.io] instance to generate the diagrams.
For your own documentation, replace the references to kroki.io with your own kroki instance.

Generate the documentation as HTML representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateHTML
----

Generate the documentation as PDF representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generatePDF
----

Generate the documentation as Microsite

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateSite
----

=== Appendix

If you want to build everything without the `./dtcw` script, you can use the following commands.

==== Generate the PlantUML diagrams from the Structurizr DSL

*With the Structurizr CLI via Docker Image*

[source, bash]
----
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/usr/local/structurizr structurizr/cli export -w documentation/bank.dsl -format plantuml/structurizr -output documentation/diagrams
----

*With a local installed Structurizr CLI*

* Download the https://github.com/structurizr/cli/releases[structurizr-cli], unzip and move it into `./bin/structurizr-cli` or use the latest Docker Image

[source, bash]
----
curl --show-error --location https://github.com/structurizr/cli/releases/download/{selected-version}/structurizr-cli.zip  -o tmp.zip && mkdir -p bin/structurizr-cli && unzip -d bin/structurizr-cli tmp.zip && rm tmp.zip
----

* Generate the diagrams from the structurizr workspace model

[source, bash]
----
./bin/structurizr-cli/structurizr.sh export -w documentation/bank.dsl -format plantuml/structurizr -output documentation/diagrams
----
